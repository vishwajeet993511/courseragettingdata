#Getting Data Project

#Description
This data set is the tidy data set created after the refinement and merging of different data

#Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed
six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

#process of refining data
R code implement the following

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
